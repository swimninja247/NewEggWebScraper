# GoodPC

## Background
Not everyone knows how much a pc should cost.  Most people don't even know what they need in a pc.  Thus, many people get ripped off when they buy new pc's.

Dad would have been charged 1,000 dollars for a new pc.  I was able to find better options for half the cost.  Technology solutions companies are taking advantage of consumers.

## The Solution

GoodPC will give consumers who may not be so well-versed in computer costs a chance not to pay ridiculous amounts of money.

GoodPC will allow users to search for units based on specs, function, form and compare and understand prices.

GoodPC should also provide benchmarks on how much a "typical" system should cost.

This can also extend to pc parts.  How much should a 500
W PSU cost?  How much should I be paying for a GTX 1080 ti?

**GoodPC makes a user-friendly experience for all.  We cater to those who are not technologically savvy and allow them to find and understand fair pricing for their needs.**
